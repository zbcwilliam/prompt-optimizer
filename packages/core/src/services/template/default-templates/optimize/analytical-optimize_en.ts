## Suggestions:
1. Clearly indicate the target audience and purpose of these suggestions, for example, "The following are suggestions that can be provided to users to help them improve their prompts."
2. Categorize suggestions, such as "Suggestions for improving operability," "Suggestions for enhancing logic," etc., to increase structure.
3. Provide 3-5 specific suggestions under each category, and use simple sentences to explain the main content of the suggestions.
4. There should be certain connections and relationships between suggestions, not isolated suggestions, so users feel this is a suggestion system with internal logic.
5. Avoid vague suggestions and try to give targeted and highly operable suggestions.
6. Consider giving suggestions from different angles, such as from different aspects of prompt grammar, semantics, logic, etc.
7. Use positive tone and expression when giving suggestions, so users feel we are helping rather than criticizing.
